# Healthcare-AI-Assistant
Healthcare AI Assistant A Generative AI-based system utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate healthcare information. It retrieves relevant medical data and generates contextually appropriate responses to user queries, making it effective for handling complex medical questions and scenarios.


# Healthcare AI Assistant  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
The **Healthcare AI Assistant** is a Generative AI-based system designed to provide **accurate, contextually relevant healthcare information**. Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the system retrieves domain-specific medical knowledge from a database, processes user queries, and generates precise, human-readable responses.  

Currently, the dataset includes **research papers on lung cancer**, and the chatbot is expertly trained to handle queries related to lung cancer. For other healthcare-related queries, the system searches the web for relevant information and replies accordingly. If an inappropriate or unsupported query is asked, the system will inform the user that it lacks sufficient information to provide a response.  

This project demonstrates how AI can address real-world healthcare challenges by effectively interpreting diverse user inputs, handling incomplete or ambiguous queries, and delivering actionable insights.

## ⚙️ How It Works  

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:  
   - When a user submits a query, the system retrieves relevant information from a pre-built **vector database** of medical research documents, specifically focused on **lung cancer**.  
   - The retrieved information is passed to the generative model, ensuring accuracy and relevance in the final response.  

2. **Prompt Design**:  
   - Prompts are iteratively refined to improve alignment with user intent and ensure the responses address specific medical contexts.  
   - The system adapts to different query types, such as symptom descriptions or preventive measures.  

3. **Handling General Healthcare Queries**:  
   - For queries outside the lung cancer domain, the system searches the web and generates responses based on available data.  
   - In case of unsupported queries, the system responds by stating that it doesn't have sufficient information to address the request.  

4. **System Flow**:  
   - User query → Retrieval from knowledge base → Generation of response → Delivery to user.  

5. **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - The system is evaluated for:  
     - **Retrieval Accuracy**: Precision, recall, and F1-scores.  
     - **Generated Text Quality**: BLEU/ROUGE scores and semantic similarity.  
     - **User Experience**: Response time and clarity of answers.

## 📊 Results  
- The system successfully handles queries on **lung cancer**, such as:  
  - *“What are the common symptoms of lung cancer?”*  
  - *“What are effective treatments for lung cancer?”*  
- For other healthcare queries, the system intelligently searches the web and provides responses. In case of unsupported queries, like *“What are remedies for a broken leg?”*, it replies stating it doesn't have enough information.  
- These behaviors can be observed in the conducted experiments, with screenshots attached for reference.

## 🚀 Future Plans  
- **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis**: To enhance the sensitivity and personalization of responses.  
- **Dataset Expansion**: Incorporating a wider range of medical conditions and scenarios to improve applicability.  
- **Real-Time Optimization**: Reducing latency to improve system responsiveness.
